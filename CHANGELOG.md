# Changelog

All notable changes to Rendr are documented here.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- **Sign out**: root cause was Radix DropdownMenuContent intercepting form submit before the DOM element could fire. Fixed by using `onSelect` + `useTransition` to call `signOutAction()` directly as a server action — no form needed
- **Template thumbnails**: templates with vertical-flex-centered bodies showed blank space in preview. Redesigned all templates to use top-aligned layouts

### Added
- **Search / command palette**: clicking the search button (or pressing ⌘K) opens a dialog with links to all dashboard pages; filters as you type
- **Overview redesign**: time-aware greeting ("Good morning, alex 👋"), quick-action cards, improved stat cards with icons, cleaner recent-jobs table
- **Sign out in sidebar**: clicking the user footer opens a dropdown with Settings, Billing, Sign out
- **Settings page** (`/app/settings`): view email, change password with validation
- **Docs in sidebar**: Resources section with Documentation link
- **8 redesigned templates**: Invoice, Receipt, Business Letter, Certificate — all visually upgraded with blue/violet gradients, proper typography, top-aligned content; plus 3 new: Job Offer Letter, Statement of Work, Monthly Report
- **`changePasswordAction`**: verifies current password, validates length/match, updates hash
- **Seed refresh**: `npm run db:seed` now upserts templates by name so existing users get updated HTML

## [0.6.6] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- **Sign out**: topbar "Sign out" was a dead link with no action — now calls `signOutAction` (NextAuth v5 server action) and redirects to `/login`
- **Auth / auto sign-out behind Cloudflare**: added explicit cookie configuration in `auth.ts` for production. Cloudflare Flexible SSL sends HTTP to the origin, causing NextAuth to strip the `Secure` flag and use unprefixed cookie names — every request created a new unreadable cookie, effectively signing users out immediately. Cookies are now named and flagged explicitly regardless of transport protocol.
- **Topbar mock data**: removed all hardcoded "Acme Internal", "Alex K.", "AK", "alex@acme.io", fake "Growth" badge. Topbar now receives real `user.email` from the app layout and derives initials/display from it.
- **Sidebar workspace section**: removed the redundant workspace block (showing ugly `email.split("@")[0]` strings). User identity is shown only once, in the bottom user footer.
### Added
- **Template thumbnails**: each template card now shows a scaled-down sandboxed iframe preview of the actual rendered HTML (no scripts, safe)
- **Template full-preview dialog**: eye icon on hover opens the template at full size in a modal iframe

## [0.6.5] — 2026-02-21
### Added
- `lib/starter-templates.ts`: 5 production-ready PDF templates — Invoice, Receipt, Business Letter, Certificate of Completion, Project Proposal
- New users automatically get all starter templates seeded on registration (non-blocking, via `registerAction`)
- Demo seed (`npm run db:seed`) also seeds starter templates for `demo@rendr.dev`

## [0.6.4] — 2026-02-21
### Added
- Templates dashboard: reusable HTML layouts with `{{variable}}` placeholder substitution
- Templates page (`/app/templates`): create/edit/delete dialogs, variable badges extracted from HTML, "Use in Convert" hover link per card
- Convert page: third input mode "Template" — pick a saved template, fill in variable values, generate PDF
- `app/actions/convert.ts`: template mode support — validates templateId ownership, extracts variable key/value pairs, passes to worker via `optionsJson.variables`
- `app/app/templates/_init.md`: feature init file per CLAUDE.md convention
### Fixed
- Templates Edit dialog: HTML textarea now correctly pre-fills with existing template content (was blank before)

## [0.6.3] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- Worker: added Prisma-based polling loop (every 2s) alongside pg-boss. `queue.send()` in Next.js was silently returning null so jobs never reached pg-boss. Worker now directly queries the `Job` table with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to atomically claim and process queued jobs, bypassing pg-boss for job discovery.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-02-21
### Added
- Convert page: PDF render settings — format (A4/Letter), orientation (portrait/landscape), margins (none/small/normal/large)
- Convert page: slow-job warning banner after 30s of polling with `pm2 list` hint
- Worker: landscape orientation support via `optionsJson.landscape`
- Server action `convertUrlAction`: parses and passes format/landscape/margin into `optionsJson`

## [0.6.1] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- Billing page: removed all mock data (fake Growth plan, fake Visa card, fake invoices). Now shows honest Starter/free state with a usage bar and empty invoice history.
- Sidebar: replaced hardcoded "Acme Internal" workspace and "AK" initials with real values derived from the authenticated user's email.
- App layout: now async server component — fetches `auth()` session, redirects to `/login` if unauthenticated, passes real user email to AppSidebar.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-02-21
### Added
- `/app/convert` — new dashboard page: paste a URL or raw HTML, click Convert, download the PDF. Supports both input modes (URL/HTML) with live polling and a download button on completion.
- `app/actions/convert.ts` — server action that creates a Job and enqueues it to the pg-boss queue (no API key required, works via session auth)
- `app/api/dashboard/jobs/[id]` — internal session-auth polling route used by the convert page to watch job status
- Convert added to the dashboard sidebar under Workspace
### Fixed
- `BASE_URL` in convert route, convert-async route, jobs route, and worker now checks `AUTH_URL` before `NEXTAUTH_URL` — fixes download URLs pointing to raw IP instead of rendrpdf.com when `AUTH_URL=https://rendrpdf.com` is set on the server

## [0.5.2] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- `auth.ts`: added `trustHost: true` — required for NextAuth v5 behind nginx/Cloudflare; without it, the callback URL host check fails and throws "server configuration" error
- `auth.ts`: added explicit `secret` fallback — NextAuth v5 reads `AUTH_SECRET` but server may only have `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` set; now supports both

## [0.5.1] — 2026-02-21
### Fixed
- `loginAction`: replaced `redirect: false` + manual `redirect("/app")` with `redirectTo: "/app"` — the correct NextAuth v5 server-action API. Previously the manual redirect was unreachable and users landed on the wrong page after login.
- `registerAction`: removed the `catch {}` block that was swallowing the internal NEXT_REDIRECT thrown by NextAuth on successful sign-in, causing every new registration to redirect to `/login` instead of `/app`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-02-21
### Changed
- Complete homepage redesign inspired by sent.dm: code-first, image-free, dark throughout
- Hero: centered layout, language-tabbed code block (Node.js / cURL / Python / PHP), install command pill
- Trust row: text-only company names replacing image placeholders
- Features grid: each card now contains embedded code/data demos (job JSON, webhook payload, template list, signed URL, font list, analytics stats)
- How it works: cleaner 3-step grid with status badges per step
- CTA: modernized, stripped back
### Added
- Pain points section: 4-card grid calling out the problems with DIY PDF stacks
- Job lifecycle section: 4-state visual timeline (queued → processing → rendered → delivered) with evolving JSON
- FAQ section: accordion with 8 common questions (shadcn Accordion)
- Pricing section now integrated into homepage flow

## [0.4.1] — 2026-02-21
### Changed
- Redesigned hero right side: replaced overflowing floating cards with a clean pipeline visualization (request card → processing indicator → PDF output card)
- Fixed hero vertical centering: removed asymmetric padding, content now properly centers in the viewport

## [0.4.0] — 2026-02-21
### Changed
- Redesigned footer: dark zinc-950 content section with gradient bridge into a full-width landscape photo (no cropping, natural aspect ratio)
- Removed light mode — site is now dark-only (`forcedTheme="dark"`)
- Removed ThemeToggle from navbar

## [0.3.0] — 2026-02-21
### Changed
- Redesigned hero section: split layout (text left, product visual right) featuring a live syntax-highlighted API request card and floating PDF output card with rendered-in timing badge
- Added Syne display font for hero headline and JetBrains Mono for code blocks — registered as `font-heading` and `font-mono` Tailwind utilities
- Refined navbar: active link now shows a thin underline indicator instead of background highlight; tightened opacity values and button hover states for dark-hero context
